PostgreSQL Docker hostname: 137.104.247.89:5432
PostgreSQL Docker port: 5433
PostgreSQL Docker username: postgres
PostgreSQL Docker password: project_docker

Slight problem:
    The hostname will not work outside of localhost, so
    we'd have to do everything locally. I'll keep at it
    to see if I can connect remotely to the docker.
    Until then, we can run it locally.
